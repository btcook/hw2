            <p>In addition to computer science and electrical engineering classes, I have taken business and educational studies classes
                to diversify my skillset and develop myself as a person. The business and manegement classes were taken abroad in Ireland through the UCSD
                Global Seminar program.
            </p>
            <pre>Highlighted here two a sample programming education videos I made as part of an upper-division
educational studies course at UCSD that focused on teaching block-based programming to K-12 students:</pre>

                    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.

                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFvYdtwhFp8" width="400" height="300" title="Variable Learning" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <figcaption>These video shows a variety of early coding concepts, such as nested loops, events, and variables!</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Here's an audio file of a similar program explanation to demonstrate how visually focused computer science is, 
                and highlights the lack of equity that both the class and UCSD strives to address in the broader world.
